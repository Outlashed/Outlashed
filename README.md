## AP Graduate student in Computer Science.

Currently working on expanding my proficiency in various languages while figuring out what field I want to work with.

## I'm actively training the following languages
- C#
- Python
- LUA


## I have experience with:
- Reverse Engineering
- Low Level Byte Encryption
- UI / UX Design
- Blazor framework
- Linux server hosting
- Database hosting via VPN.



Side-projects currently include various of the above-mentioned elements, but also PHP via Codeigniter.


This readme is a bit of a mess, for now I'm more focused on just learning and figuring this all out; than making this a proper readme.
